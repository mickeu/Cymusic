# Native Upgrade and Retained Data Contracts

## 1. Scope / Trigger

Apply these contracts when changing Expo/RN, native dependencies, local-media access,
storage adapters, or the share extension. They describe the retained CyMusic owners;
an SDK template is a reference for integration changes, not a replacement project.

The current retained-native target is Expo **57.0.21**, React Native **0.86.3**,
React **19.2.3**, New Architecture and Hermes HBC **98**, with iOS **16.4+**.
Its framework and self-owned module verification is summarized in
`../../../docs/maintenance/2026-09-10-results.md`; the current playback engine is
`@rntp/player` **5.9.2**, with its separate migration results in
`../../../docs/maintenance/2026-09-10-rntp-v5.md`.
Its optional iOS asset-timing policy is recorded in
`../../../docs/maintenance/2026-09-10-precise-seeking.md`.
Use the existing `package.json`, `yarn.lock` and `ios/Podfile.lock` as one graph;
do not independently advance React/RN or replace the retained iOS project with a
generated template. Earlier Debug/Release builds and M01–M12 manual acceptance
retain their original scope; they do not validate later playback changes.
Each migration record distinguishes actual runtime checks, builds and device limits.

The current file/dependency assessment is in
`../../../docs/audit/2026-09-09/report.md`. Retired intermediate evidence is indexed
by that report’s cleanup appendix; the reusable contracts below remain active.
A simulator result does not establish physical background playback, signing or
all functional acceptance.

## 3. Contracts

### Local paths, identities and deletion

- Raw absolute paths preserve literal percent sequences: `/a/%23.mp3` names a
  percent-containing file. File URIs may be encoded or old concatenated strings.
  The resolver checks decoded-once and literal interpretations without parsing
  away filename `#` or `?`. Two existing interpretations are ambiguous, not a
  reason to choose one. Only the historically produced `file://file:///` prefix
  is normalized; malformed authority, separators and traversal are rejected.
- `filePath` is the native path for filesystem operations; `fileUri` encodes each
  path segment once for RNTP, native image loading and sharing. The `/private/var/`
  alias is normalized only for comparisons, not for native I/O spelling.
- Relocation is lazy. A missing old path can move only within the same recognized
  `Containers/Data/Application/<UUID>/Documents` or `Library` ancestry as the
  native current roots. Library relocation is limited to `Caches/ImagePicker/`.
  Do not globally replace UUIDs or search another application's container.
- Reading an existing supplied file and deleting an owned media file are separate
  contracts. Deletion requires a file under current `Documents/importedLocalMusic/`,
  `Documents/download/music/` or `Documents/musicCache/`, plus plain directory
  ancestry. A symlink, directory, ambiguous name or I/O failure cannot establish
  an owned deletion target.
- Media IDs are opaque, including URI-shaped IDs. Deletion first selects exactly
  one existing record by ID and resolves that record's URL. It rechecks identity
  after asynchronous work and filters the latest list so concurrent imports
  survive. Unknown/duplicate IDs are no-ops. Explicit removal may discard an
  unresolved record, but must not guess a file to delete.
- `MusicSourceResolver.resolveSource` owns current/preload resolution. An unresolved
  local address returns the existing fake-audio fallback; only current requests
  display its existing error. Playlist cover hydration projects resolved addresses
  into live state without rewriting persisted IDs, nested songs or URLs.

### Storage ownership and migration

- Keep `appPersistStatus` and `MediaExtra.<platform>` database identities, media
  keys, and iOS roots `Documents/mmkv` / `Documents/cache/mmkv` unchanged. The
  factory caches instances by database name; do not reuse one name for both roots.
- PersistStatus values remain JSON strings. `undefined` deletes a key; missing or
  malformed JSON reads as `null`. Consumers remove their value-change listeners
  on cleanup. Adapt a new MMKV library's API at these existing owners rather than
  adding a second store or converting all persisted values.
- With MMKV4, instantiate through `createMMKV`, keep `MMKV` type-only where used
  as a type, and delete through `remove`. Retain the explicit database paths even
  though the application has an App Group: accepting the library's default path
  can select a different storage location. Do not replace the factory cache,
  database IDs, JSON representation or subscription ownership as part of this API
  adaptation. `MMKV.remove` reports whether a key was removed; the existing
  PersistStatus setter still returns void and preserves its public contract.
- `music.play-list` is the current queue, `music.playList` its legacy fallback,
  and `music.playLists` user playlists. They are not aliases. Current queue wins;
  only a missing current queue allows the existing legacy migration and deletion
  of its legacy key. Preserve the existing startup defaults as a measured baseline.
- AsyncStorage chunking in `src/helpers/storage.ts` retains the 500000-character
  limit, `@___PART___` prefix, comma-separated part references, JSON representation,
  removal semantics and rethrown I/O failures. A logger compatibility change must
  not alter serialization or silently consume errors.
- Before the first write with a new storage core, keep a quiescent byte backup and
  a logical export. Compare first read, controlled first write and second launch.
  Git rollback does not restore a database written by a newer native core.
- A subject written by MMKV4 must not launch the old MMKV2 binary against those
  rewritten files. Recovery pairs the original binary with its original quiescent
  data on a separately identified disposable subject. Raw byte changes after a
  normal MMKV write are not logical data loss; compare the full logical values as
  well as media and App Group files.

### Filesystem module and downloads

- Expo FileSystem owns ordinary I/O. `CyMusicFileSystemPaths` supplies the original
  synchronous raw Foundation directory roots and `Darwin.lstat` queries. Only
  ENOENT/ENOTDIR mean absent; other native failures propagate. A dangling symlink
  still exists as a symlink and cannot prove an owned regular-file deletion.
  Do not substitute `File.exists` for the non-following type/ancestry contract.
- Preserve `getLocalFilePath`'s stored/returned string. `getCacheFileUri` derives a
  separate canonical I/O URI from the known raw filename, encoding path segments
  once. Feed document-picker URIs directly to `new File(uri).text()` without first
  decoding the entire string.
- `downloadFile` uses the official Expo `/legacy` foreground resumable API because
  it exposes actual HTTP status. Only 200 moves the unique temporary file into its
  final destination; all other statuses reject. This API still uses Expo Modules.
- Keep the original temporary URI immutable: `File.move` changes the source File's
  URI. Cleaning that moved instance would delete the final file. In `finally`,
  cancel the DownloadResumable to remove its progress subscription and clean the
  original temporary URI. Cleanup errors are logged without replacing the main
  result/error. Never sweep unrelated cache files to conceal a leaked task.
- Explicit overwrite can delete the old target before move completes. Do not claim
  atomic replacement or unconditional preservation after a move failure. Expo's
  public foreground download has no equivalents for the former RNFS15-second
  request/one-hour resource timeouts and disables URLCache; retain these documented
  differences when changing adapters.

### Expo57 native graph and Metro ownership

- The verified local tool set is Node24.19.0, Yarn1.22.22, CocoaPods1.16.2 and
  Xcode26.6. Keep frozen Yarn installation, `patch-package --error-on-fail` and
  deployment-locked Pods. `README.md` distinguishes fresh installation from
  recovery of an existing Pods configuration; a completed build is not an
  instruction to reinstall its dependencies.
- Preserve the custom Swift AppDelegate integration, native source/preload
  membership, extension and privacy manifests. Expo57 prebuild defaults to clean;
  it must not regenerate over these retained owners. Build caches and DerivedData
  belong to the actual checkout path; copied ModuleCache/PCM files do not establish
  clean reproducibility.
- `metro.config.js` owns the native Axios resolution exception. For module name
  `axios` on iOS/Android, delegate with `unstable_enablePackageExports: false` to
  retain the browser/XHR entry for both import and require callers. Delegate all
  other module/platform combinations unchanged. Do not disable exports for the
  entire dependency graph or create a second HTTP adapter in consumers.
- Keep `babel-preset-expo` responsible for the compatible Worklets transform;
  adding a duplicate legacy Reanimated plugin is not the Reanimated4 migration.

### iOS menu icon color boundary

**Scope / trigger:** iOS 16.6 reports missing icons in both menu consumers even
with the original zero-tint native patch present in the verified Release IPA.
On 2026-09-14 the user confirmed restored menu icons with the JS-only candidate
IPA. This validates the workaround on the reported device without establishing
the exact internal UIKit failure mechanism.

**Signatures:** retain `MenuView`/`MenuAction` and native codegen props. The patched
package's private `processAction(action, isDark)` owns recursive color defaults.

**Contracts:** on iOS, an action with an image and null/omitted `imageColor` gets
opaque black in light appearance or white in dark appearance. Destructive actions
use `#ff3b30` / `#ff453a`. An explicit light/dark `themeVariant` takes precedence;
otherwise use `useColorScheme()`. Compute `actionsHash` after resolving colors.

**Validation / error matrix:** explicit colors, including zero, retain existing
processing; text-only actions do not acquire images or colors; Android retains
its original defaults. Unknown/system theme variants follow device appearance,
and a null appearance resolves to light. Keep IDs, attributes and callbacks intact.

**Good / base / bad:** nested icons update with theme (good); explicit icon color
is preserved (base); filling colors after hashing leaves stale native colors (bad).

**Tests:** `scripts/check-menu-icons.mjs` executes the source, ESM and CommonJS
entries at their native-component boundary. Assert opaque defaults, destructive
colors, nested actions, theme/hash changes, overrides and event forwarding. Keep
generated JS/maps synchronized. Test actual iOS 16.6 menus in both themes before
claiming the reported rendering failure is resolved; a newer simulator is separate.
The recorded user acceptance confirms icon restoration; individual theme,
submenu and disabled-action cases were not separately reported.

**Wrong vs correct:** do not infer missing native patches from identical symptoms;
compare the reported IPA with its Actions artifact and inspect the native code.
Do not add repeated color fixes to individual screens; use the shared package entry.

### RNTP v5 playback and queue ownership

- Pin `@rntp/player@5.9.2` and `RNTPPlayer`; remove active RNTP4 imports and
  SwiftAudioEx. Keep app `Track` types in `src/player/types.ts` and persisted
  `IMusicItem` records unchanged. `store/playList.ts` owns the business queue;
  `helpers/trackPlayerIndex.ts` owns playback, resolution and repeat/shuffle.
- Project a resolved source only at `toMediaItem`: `album` → `albumTitle`,
  `artwork` → `artworkUrl`, and headers → `url: { uri, headers }`. A real item uses
  `mediaId = cymusic:${JSON.stringify([platform, id])}` and
  `extras.cymusic = { id, platform, token, placeholder: false }`. Native getters
  lose HTTP headers and can return raw local paths; retain the full resolved
  source in JS instead of reconstructing a source from those getters.
- Resolve local records through the existing path owner before this projection.
  Empty, malformed and bare asset names must fail before native invocation;
  RNTP's missing iOS asset path can trap. A persisted raw filename remains valid
  input to the app resolver, but is not a valid direct input to `toMediaItem`.
- Native queue remains real item + bundled silent placeholder. Native repeat is
  `Off` and native shuffle is false. Every replacement, including SINGLE replay,
  receives a fresh token; a placeholder uses `cymusic:placeholder:${token}`.
  Advance once only when event index/item, synchronous active item, queue token,
  current business selection and play intent agree. Ignore empty, stale and
  duplicate transitions; a resumed pending placeholder completes its handoff.
- Keep one root setup owner and idempotent module-lifetime subscriptions. v5 has
  no `registerPlaybackService`. Commands return void and getters are synchronous;
  `await` is not a playback-readiness or seek-completion barrier. `progressSync`
  uses `intervalSeconds: 1`; without an endpoint it emits local events and writes
  RNTP's native saved-progress preference, not a second MMKV schema.
- Set commands to hybrid with only Next/Previous handled in JS. Native owns
  Play/Pause/Seek/Stop. The pinned Swift patch emits the explicitly chosen hybrid
  Play/Pause/Stop event once after native execution; JS only calls
  `observeNativeTransport`, never executes that transport twice. Do not infer
  the selected toggle action from state after it has already changed.
- Source tokens reject superseded requests, including same-track replacement.
  Pause retains a still-current late source as paused; Stop retains it stopped.
  A direct selection/reset retires the old skip-operation token, and an old
  `finally` cannot release a newer operation's lock. User controls increment a
  revision so a delayed 500 ms recovery cannot override a newer action.
- Playback errors have no item identity. Check the actual current real item and
  Error state before scheduling recovery, then recheck queue/source/revision.
  Stop a valid failed native item to retain its source for an immediate native
  Play retry; clear when there is no valid current native item. A newer explicit
  control cancels the old delayed Next in either case.
  Progress/lyrics require current mediaId and an event timestamp no earlier than
  that queue generation; placeholder progress cannot become a saved real track.
- Use boolean `useIsPlaying()` independently from `PlaybackState`: Ready can be
  paused. Show Pause for actual output, or play intent while source loading or
  Buffering; Ready with no output shows Play after a native interruption. Hook
  progress intervals are seconds (`0.25` / `1`), not legacy milliseconds.
  Removing the current song uses the same actual-output/loading distinction;
  deleting a song after a native interruption must not start the next one.
  v5's polling hook does not reset its sample on transition. Use it to drive
  the existing interval, then return the facade's current synchronous progress
  snapshot on render; a new song must not inherit the prior song's duration
  for display or slider calculations, including before the next poll.
- Retain Expo system-volume and sleep owners, existing caches/downloads and
  source protocols. RNTP gain is not system volume; do not silently add RNTP
  cache/preload/sleep owners. Hot disposal must retire pending work, clear its
  native queue and remove subscriptions.
- RNTP's preserved third-party license applies independently of CyMusic's
  Apache-2.0 source license. Keep the exact pinned notice and record local patches;
  the official App's free personal/non-commercial policy does not revoke prior
  Apache grants or grant RNTP rights beyond its license.

### Per-item precise seeking

- Settings exposes an iOS-only, default-off Boolean using the existing
  `PersistStatus` owner. Read with `=== true`; do not coerce strings/numbers or
  create a second preference store. A toggle writes only `music.preciseSeeking`
  and issues no playback, queue, source-resolution or setup command. Its visible
  localized description must explain possible complete-file loading and
  activation after changing tracks.
- `setTrackSource` samples the preference after source resolution and current
  request validation, immediately before `toMediaItem`. The pure projection
  receives it explicitly, preserves `extras.cymusic` identity and URL/headers,
  and emits `extras.cymusicPlayback.preciseSeeking`. Explicit live items and
  silent placeholders emit false. Do not persist transport policy on songs or
  infer formats/live status from URL suffixes, quality labels or MIME strings.
- New App item construction, including explicit reconstruction and SINGLE
  replay, samples the latest setting. Native retry, Stop → Play, Play/Pause
  and metadata updates retain the current item's snapshot. A later preference
  write must not reload that item or transfer a retired item's policy forward.
- The RNTP patch decodes an actual CFBoolean under `extras.cymusicPlayback`;
  `NSNumber(1)`/`NSNumber(0)`, null, strings and malformed containers do not
  enable precision. `AudioItem.prefersPreciseTiming` defaults to false; both
  `AudioPlayer` load sites pass the retained value to
  `PlayerEngine.load(url:headers:isLive:prefersPreciseTiming:)`.
- `AVPlayerEngine` normalizes `requested && !isLive` into immutable
  `SourceContext`. Direct/proxy construction, both one-shot direct fallbacks
  and live refresh carry that same context. Add
  `AVURLAssetPreferPreciseDurationAndTimingKey` only when true; omit it otherwise.
  Preserve HTTP/ICY behavior, load-generation/cache-key guards and reset cleanup.
  Proxy assets must not receive origin authorization headers.
- Keep the normal AVPlayerItem initializer, stalling policy and zero-tolerance
  seek. The observed bug is a disagreement between decoded content and the
  native timeline. A matching player clock and lyric index is not content proof;
  a `.playing` state is not proof of the first decoded audio. Use sequential
  reference decoding plus a contiguous PCM match, and separately measure first
  PCM from before native `load`. Cold limited-bandwidth tests must use fresh
  origins/paths and report unique transferred bytes. Full-file preparation is
  a documented cost of the user's opt-in, not a reason to change quality or lyrics.

### New Architecture list and image consumers

- The lyrics screen owns its four-column toolbar: equal flexible touch targets,
  `minWidth: 0`, at least 44pt hit height, and the parent safe-area padding. The
  delay panel uses three shrinkable controls with a wider value/reset control;
  do not restore the fixed 130pt minimum inside an equal-width wrapper. Keep the
  ordinary player footer independent. Verify actual narrow-screen layout, the
  expanded panel, font/delay buttons, and repeated player/lyrics transitions.

- FlashList2.0.2 auxiliary slots such as `ListEmptyComponent` and
  `ListFooterComponent` require an accepted element/plain function. A raw
  `React.memo` component object can be dropped by its `getValidComponent` path.
  `NowPlayList` supplies `<EmptyListComponent />` / `<ItemDivider />`, and
  `SearchList` supplies `!isLoading ? <EmptyComponent /> : null`. Keep those
  loading/footer conditions and the existing callbacks, keys and queue owners.
  `ItemSeparatorComponent` has a separate rendering path; do not rewrite every
  slot merely because one auxiliary slot failed.
- For the mini-player, animate the surrounding view and keep the displayed URI
  and recycling key stable while the track is unchanged. Preserve content fit, cache policy and
  fallback artwork. An ordinary loaded cover is insufficient evidence for a
  change affecting delayed/failing sources: repeated native image recreation was
  observed in the directly animated image path.
- The full player's `usePlayerBackground` owns normalized six-digit hex colors:
  select iOS `background` (its `primary` is contrasting foreground) and Android/web
  `dominant`. Scale RGB together to keep relative luminance at most `0.1`; use
  `#191b20` for missing/invalid/pending/failed results. Associate state with the
  requested URI during render and retire asynchronous writes on cleanup. Keep
  the hook's 50-entry LRU cache bounded and the library's unbounded cache disabled.
- The full player and every artwork fade stop share the same base RGB; the fade
  must become opaque before the white title and translucent artist label. A dark
  palette alone does not establish contrast while bright artwork remains beneath
  those labels. Inspect a pure-white cover as well as normal warm/cool covers on
  both regular and compact layouts.
- Full-player artwork keeps its size while paused and animates through its
  enclosing view, preserving the memoized source, recycling key and placeholder.
  Always reset horizontal translation in `onFinalize`, including cancelled and
  unsuccessful skips. Let vertical movement fail the horizontal recognizer so
  it can reach the existing screen dismissal. Native drag/swipe behavior requires
  actual gesture evidence; a coordinate action that only taps does not establish it.

### System volume, request grace and sleep deadlines

- `CyMusicVolumeModule` owns system output volume through AVAudioSession KVO and
  a retained MPVolumeView/UISlider on the main queue. It must not set the audio
  session category, mode or activation; the playback owner keeps those decisions.
  Keep the system volume HUD enabled. A resolved slider write is not proof that
  physical output volume changed, especially on a simulator.
- Register KVO with both `.initial` and `.new`, assigning its observation
  generation before `observe`. The Expo first-listener hook can reach the main
  queue after the initial `getVolume` call; `.new` alone loses a hardware change
  in that gap. Retire observation on the last listener and module destruction.
  Queued callbacks and delayed initial React reads cannot update a retired owner.
- The two existing HTTP owners share `createRequestTimeout`: ordinary runtime
  timers drive AbortController, while a separate finite UIKit task preserves
  background grace. Manual abort clears the timer and releases the task
  immediately; `finally` also covers request-data preparation and response errors.
  Preserve each owner's parsing, headers, encoding and error mapping.
- Normalize a cancelled fetch at its existing request owner using that request's
  `AbortController.signal.aborted`. Expo's native cancellation error text differs
  from the old literal `Aborted`. Produce the existing raw `Aborted` error only
  for an actually cancelled controller, then let the existing public wrappers
  map it (`httpFetch` maps it to its timeout message). A non-cancelled request
  retains its original error object even if its text resembles cancellation.
- The JS release closure and `CyMusicRequestTaskRegistry` each settle their own
  resource once. A late native task identifier is ended if its operation already
  finished. Expiration, denial, duplicate end and module invalidation cannot leak
  or double-end a UIKit task. UIKit denial must not prevent an ordinary request.
- `src/utils/delay.ts` retains its milliseconds-to-Promise<void> contract for
  the existing 500ms player recovery and 120ms lyric retry. It uses the same finite
  grace owner and releases it on completion, including a late native return.
- Sleep scheduling remains separate from HTTP timeouts: one wall-clock deadline
  and native generation feed `timingClose.ts`, which checks both before calling
  the existing player facade's `pause`. Cancel/replacement rejects queued stale
  events; expiry invalidates its generation before awaiting pause. Native and JS
  foreground checks handle an overdue current deadline once.
- Handle a synchronous native schedule failure before publishing JS deadline or
  generation. The existing custom-minute input can supply a non-finite number;
  log the failure and keep the previous timer, rather than throwing from its UI
  callback or publishing a timer that the native owner rejected.
- Sleep subscriptions live for the module, independently of the player screen.
  Hot disposal removes subscriptions and cancels the native timer; the countdown
  hook cleans its interval on replacement, expiry and unmount. No process exit,
  track-end scheduling or Expo BackgroundTask substitution belongs in this path.
  Finite UIKit grace and background audio do not provide perpetual iOS execution.

### Native and share boundaries

- The self-owned JSC engine is `modules/cymusic-native/ios/CyMusicUserApiRuntime.h/.m`
  (NSObject), wrapped by `CyMusicSourceModule.swift` under module name
  `UserApiModule`. The local Expo Pod alone compiles the core; do not restore the
  deleted app-target RCT module or compile the same core twice. Its public header,
  JavaScriptCore/Security frameworks and Expo module registration belong together.
- Keep the actual `ios/CyMusic/user-api-preload.js` as an app bundle resource.
  The source-tree preload copy is different and is not its substitute. Preserve
  script protocol, metadata, crypto and evaluation on the private serial JSC queue;
  the custom runtime remains separate from RN's Hermes engine.
- Every load/destroy creates a runtime generation. Native commands, cancellable
  one-shot timers and buffered events belong to that generation. The JS facade
  checks the envelope generation before parsing or merging metadata, including
  events already queued by Expo. Use instance-targeted `emit(event:payload:)`.
- A per-load disposer connects facade retirement with the LX adapter's init/music
  promises, HTTP controllers, timers, maps and listener. Settle pending work once;
  late callbacks/finally blocks cannot delete newer entries with a reused key.
  Music attempts use distinct internal IDs while preserving the caller's business
  request context and script action/musicInfo/quality.
- Native last-listener removal preserves the running JSC context and current
  buffered events. Destroy/load cancel old native timers; clearTimeout reaches the
  actual native timer owner. Merely discarding a JS callback does not free that
  timer. Module invalidation clears timers, context, buffer and event handler.
- Preserve bundle identity `com.music.player.gyc`, the extension identity, URL
  scheme, App Group `group.com.music.player.gyc` and key `cymusicShareKey`. Upgrade
  the extension writer, patched native reader and JS parser as a paired protocol.
  When changing web-URL serialization, accept pending payloads from the previous
  installed version in order; do not clear or eagerly rewrite them during decoding.
- The SDK52 web-URL reader accepts v3 JSON Data and legacy plist `[String]` values.
  `decodeWebUrl(data: Data) -> [WebUrl]?` must remain fallible: its caller returns
  the established `"empty"` result for malformed JSON, file-record Data or URL
  records missing required metadata. Never force-unwrap this decoded input or
  remove the shared key on decode failure. Preserve the existing media decoder's
  separately measured behavior; this guard is specific to the changed web-URL path.
- Keep full `#clip` text, including embedded URLs, and the existing file/text/PDF
  paths. Host and extension privacy manifests both declare the applicable
  UserDefaults reasons `CA92.1` and `1C8F.1`. Resource presence and simulator ad-hoc
  signatures do not prove provisioned physical-device App Group access.
- For RNTP seek assertions, observe bounded convergence of position, active track
  identity and playing state. RNTP v5 `seekTo` returns void; returning from the
  call is not proof that the native player has completed its seek.
- Preserve the existing separate CommonJS/LX runtime owners. The CommonJS
  four-argument `getMusicUrl` protocol has no generic cancellation/destroy API.
  Actual selection of CommonJS retires the prior LX runtime via the existing reload
  owner; test-only CommonJS validation does not. Do not claim generic cancellation
  of arbitrary CommonJS scripts. Source-switch UI success alone does not establish
  internal HTTP/timer/listener cleanup; use owner-specific evidence.

## 4. Validation & Error Matrix

| Recognized relocation candidate absent | `unresolved: missing` |
| Candidate exists but is not a regular file | `unresolved: not-file` |
| Deletion candidate outside owned media roots | `unresolved: unowned`; record removal never implies disk deletion |
| Relocated/deletion path has non-directory ancestry | `unresolved: unsafe-path` |
| Native existence/stat access throws | `unresolved: unreadable`; no inference that the file is absent |
| Unknown/duplicate deletion ID | No file deletion and no list mutation |

| New native binary loads JavaScript from another SDK stage | Invalid checkpoint; coordinate the correct Metro/bundle first |
| MMKV4 constructor omits the explicit old database path | Invalid storage adaptation even if a new empty store opens successfully |
| Old MMKV2 binary is paired with MMKV4-written files | Invalid recovery; restore the matching original binary and data together |
| FlashList auxiliary slot receives an unsupported memo object | Preserve the same component/condition but provide its React element |
| Axios native resolution chooses its Node entry | Fix the scoped Metro resolution owner, not each request caller |
| HTTP206/404/500 or transport failure during file download | Reject; no final commit; original temp and progress listener cleaned |
| Old native api-action arrives after load/destroy | Drop before JSON parsing and source metadata merge |
| Old request callback/finally completes after runtime replacement | No settlement/deletion of a new runtime's entry; retired transport aborted |
| Timer A200ms is replaced after30ms by runtime B's callback0 at1000ms | A is physically cancelled; B cannot fire at A's old deadline |
| System volume changes between the initial read and KVO registration | Initial KVO snapshot delivers the current value; no lost startup update |
| Request finishes before its native background-task identifier returns | End the late task exactly once; do not keep a lease for completed work |
| Sleep timer is cancelled/replaced before an old event reaches JS | No pause from that stale generation/deadline |
| New sleep schedule fails synchronously | Keep the previous deadline/generation; log without escaping the UI callback |
| Empty/duplicate/stale RNTP placeholder transition | No business queue advance |
| Source resolves after Pause or Stop for the same selection | Load paused/stopped; a later explicit Play can resume |
| Old skip request finishes after direct selection and a new skip | Old completion cannot clear the new lock or replace the selected source |
| Error recovery delay outlives a user transport/selection | Discard the old recovery; do not undo the user action |
| RNTP Ready with `isPlaying() === false` and no loading | Show Play; Ready alone does not establish audio output |
| Source passed to native lacks a resolved URI | Reject at the app boundary, before any iOS asset lookup |
| Precision preference missing, null, numeric or string | Off; no implicit migration or coercion |
| Preference toggled during playback or source resolution | Current item unchanged; next valid App item snapshots the latest value |
| Native retry or Stop → Play after a preference change | Reload the retained item's old policy |
| Explicit live/placeholder item, even when preference is on | Omit precise asset timing; no format/live guessing |
| Proxy error or item-failure fallback | Retain the full source policy and existing headers; consume fallback once |
| New load/reset followed by a stale item callback | Existing generation/cache guards prevent retired policy from taking over |
| PCM match weak/ambiguous, interrupted or discontinuous | Invalid content evidence; never replace it with clock agreement |

## 5. Good / Base / Bad Cases

- **Good:** update in place, re-resolve native roots, play an untouched stale URL
  through the real resolver/player, and confirm stored IDs plus media hashes match.
- **Base:** an existing raw Unicode filename resolves to one encoded URI; a normal
  HTTPS source continues through the existing remote-source owner.
- **Good:** a final native artifact and its actual generated/embedded JS use the
  same frozen graph; storage reads retain their old identities and an emptied
  queue renders the existing empty-state element.
- **Bad:** decode every string twice, replace all container UUIDs in JSON, use an
  ID as a pathname, clear MMKV after a read error, or treat a resolved seek promise
  and a successful compilation as functional acceptance.
- **Good:** real end → current placeholder → one business Next; SINGLE repeats
  with a fresh token and retained headers on every cycle. A late resolver after
  Pause can load the same track but cannot restart its clock.
- **Base:** native Pause executes once, its hybrid event updates JS intent, and
  the app's existing sleep deadline calls the same facade pause owner.
- **Bad:** rebuild a source from the native getter, enable native repeat beside
  the business queue, or replay Play/Pause from a hybrid observation event.
- **Good:** a preference change leaves the current queue/token and playback
  untouched; the next App item uses it, and both native fallback paths retain it.
- **Base:** off preserves the original asset options; an explicitly live item
  also omits precision even if the user's preference is on.
- **Bad:** enable precision with a truthy numeric extra, force an active reload,
  or adjust lyric timing to hide an independently measured audio seek error.

## 6. Tests Required

Use focused task fixtures and native runs; this contract does not require adding a
test framework. Re-run assertions affected by the change and record exact inputs.

1. Local representation/relocation: raw and encoded Unicode, literal percent,
   raw `#`/`?`, duplicate scheme, ambiguity, malformed escapes, directories,
   traversal, symlinks and different-container ancestry. Assert exact result and
   zero unexpected deletion. Use `scripts/check-local-files.mjs` and
   `scripts/check-native-files.swift`; concurrent add/delete assertions retain records.
2. Real current/preload playback, canonical RNTP/share URI, exact selected-record
   deletion and cold cover projection/decode. Keep a failing pre-fix report and test
   the original stale records; do not reseed them with already-correct URLs.
3. Quiescent backup hashes before/after installation, all logical MMKV/AsyncStorage
   values, controlled first write and second launch. Account explicitly for normal
   active-track/progress writes; migration is never validated by uninstall/reset.
4. Both script formats, request success/error/timeout/cancel/correlation/reload,
   local/online audio, queue/timer and seek observations. Restore protected state
   and confirm cleanup. Unsupported legacy APIs are recorded unsupported, not passed.
5. Actual extension → App Group → native reader → parser → host UI for changed
   payloads, including pending old format; native export bytes must match. Keep
   simulator, DevLauncher and physical signed behavior as distinct evidence.
   For changed native decoders, run wrong-kind/malformed/missing-field inputs
   against the actual methods and assert safe rejection plus byte-identical
   preferences. Preserve pre-fix trap evidence separately from the fixed result.
6. Package alignment, strict patches, locked Pods, retained native resources and
   matching SDK binary/JS. Compare inherited type/lint diagnostics precisely;
   do not weaken checks to hide a new failure.
7. For an Expo57 native change, verify RN/React identity, Fabric/bridgeless and
   actual Hermes98 bytecode rather than inferring them from configuration alone.
   Verify original-root reproduction separately from the isolated candidate;
   simulator ad-hoc verification does not establish signed-device entitlement use.
8. For affected list/image consumers, assert real one-row-to-empty and reopened
   empty states, loading conditions, row identity and matched delayed/failing
   image request behavior. A source check or selected frame does not prove an
   entire gesture or loading interval.
9. File downloads: `scripts/check-file-downloads.mjs`, plus actual iOS200/non200/
   transport fixtures. Check final bytes after cleanup, progress-listener counts,
   special filenames, and brief native playback. A mock move failure cannot prove
   native atomicity or old-target preservation.
10. Source lifetimes: `scripts/check-source-host.mjs` and
    `scripts/check-source-runtime.mjs` execute host owners and the real Foundation/
    JSC core. Assert A/B timer isolation, cancellation, buffered generations,
    crypto vectors, one-time settlement and retired HTTP socket closure. After
    native integration, also verify unique Expo registration, mixed compilation,
    bundled preload bytes and activation/retirement on iOS.
11. Native services: `scripts/check-volume.mjs`,
    `scripts/check-volume-native.mjs`, `scripts/check-request-timers.mjs`,
    `scripts/check-sleep-timer.mjs` and `scripts/check-native-services.mjs`
    cover the actual host owners and Foundation cores. Preserve the failing
    `.new`-only KVO reproduction, late lease/expiry cleanup, real deadline
    cancellation and stale-generation checks. A signalled native test process
    must fail; `status: null` is not exit code zero. After integration, check
    Expo registration and actual iOS events/HTTP closure without equating them
    to private lease counts or physical-device background/volume acceptance.
12. RNTP: `scripts/check-rntp-player.mjs` executes changed JS owners for source
    projection, once-only initialization, transition/recovery tokens, queue
    operations, paused/loading controls and superseded requests.
    `scripts/check-rntp-remote-native.mjs` compiles extracted actual Swift handlers;
    assert exactly one selected native action and the correct hybrid event across
    handling modes and player states. Preserve the pristine-upstream failure
    comparison. On iOS verify local/HTTP playback and headers, progress/lyrics,
    bounded seek, two consecutive SINGLE replays, Next/Previous/shuffle, native
    sleep pause and data cleanup. Actual hardware command delivery remains a
    separate check from executing the native handlers on the host.
13. Precise seeking: `scripts/check-rntp-precise-seeking.mjs` compiles actual
    installed decoder, load and fallback methods. Assert strict Boolean input,
    both AudioPlayer forwarding sites, direct/proxy option absence/presence,
    retained retry policy, headers/ICY and stale/reset isolation. The existing
    live-edge test seam bypasses asset creation and is insufficient here.
    Its optional `--pcm CONFIG [--simulator UUID]` mode captures decoded content
    through the patched loading/install/seek boundary. Use original FLAC from
    `scripts/fixtures/generate-flac-seek-fixture.py`, a fresh controlled source
    from `range-media-server.py`, and independent `match-rntp-pcm.py` results.
    Keep media, private source URLs and generated binaries outside Git. Check
    forward/backward content, pause/resume, other formats and cold startup cost;
    preserve failing/default controls separately. A rebuilt App must additionally
    show persistence, non-interrupting toggles, later-item activation, lyrics
    after seeking and retained lyric-delay behavior. Real gestures/listening and
    physical-device behavior require their own named evidence.

Reuse completed evidence unless a change or unresolved concern requires a new
check. User-confirmed manual steps are valid evidence for their named visible
behavior; record that attribution and retain separately unmeasured internal,
raw-storage and device conditions. Do not repeat a manual test solely to obtain
an automated count.

## 7. Wrong vs Correct

```ts
// Wrong: a persisted ID may look like a URI, and a URI is not a native path.
await RNFS.unlink(decodeURIComponent(musicId.replace('file://', '')))

// Correct boundary: select the existing record, then resolve its owned URL.
const record = items.find((item) => item.id === musicId)
if (record) {
  const local = await resolveLocalFile(record.url, { requireOwnedMedia: true })
  if (local.status === 'resolved') {
    // The production deletion owner also rechecks uniqueness/concurrent state.
    await FileSystem.deleteAsync(local.fileUri)
  }
}
```

Do not duplicate this deletion flow in new consumers; call the existing owner.

```ts
// Wrong for the final MMKV4 graph: changes construction/path or uses the old API.
const replacement = new MMKV({ id: dbName })
replacement.delete(key)

// Correct: keep the existing factory and explicit path; adapt only the API.
const store = getOrCreateMMKV(dbName)
store.remove(key)
```

```tsx
// Wrong for FlashList2's auxiliary memo-component path.
<FlashList ListEmptyComponent={EmptyListComponent} />

// Correct: same component and visible behavior, accepted element representation.
<FlashList ListEmptyComponent={<EmptyListComponent />} />
```

```ts
// Wrong for v5: the getter is synchronous and discards resolved-source headers.
TrackPlayer.getActiveMediaItem().then((item) => replay(item))

// Correct: read the native projection for observation only; the facade retains
// the resolved app track for replay. A seek must be checked over bounded time.
const active = TrackPlayer.getActiveMediaItem()
TrackPlayer.seekTo(5)
// Observe getProgress().position, active identity and isPlaying() convergence.
```

```ts
// Wrong: applying a preference by replacing the active item interrupts playback.
PersistStatus.set('music.preciseSeeking', enabled)
TrackPlayer.setMediaItems([toMediaItem(current, newToken, false, { preciseSeeking: enabled })])

// Correct Settings handler: a single preference write.
PersistStatus.set('music.preciseSeeking', enabled)
// The existing setTrackSource owner samples it at the next valid construction.
const options = { preciseSeeking: PersistStatus.get('music.preciseSeeking') === true }
const item = toMediaItem(resolvedTrack, token, false, options)
```
